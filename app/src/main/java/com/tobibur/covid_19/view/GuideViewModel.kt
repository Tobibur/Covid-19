A study from 2010 in cells in a dish — which, it’s important to point out, are not full people — found that zinc blocked replication of the first SARS coronavirus. In humans, however, the data is conflicting. One meta-analysis of seven different studies found that zinc supplements shortened the duration of a cold, which may have been caused by either a coronavirus or a rhinovirus, by 33%. A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published by the same scientist did not see any difference in cold symptom duration between people who took zinc and those who took a placebo."
